Windows OS:
---------------
Server 
	- Windows Server 2003
	- Windows Server 2008 
	- Windows Server 2008R2	(2k8R2)	// R2 = Release 2
	- Windows Server 2012 	(2k12)
	- Windows Server 2012R2 (2k12R2)
	- Windows Server 2016	(2k16)
	- Windows Server 2019	(2k19)
	- Windows Server 2022	(2k22)
	
	CLI version of Windows SVR --> "Server Core OS"
		Server Core OS uses "sconfig.cmd" to manage the OS.
	
	in Windows Server 2016, MS release NANO server


Client
	- a client OS will ask for the services from the server and allow user to work with them
		ex: DHCP service
	- Editions
		- Windows XP
		- Windows 7
		- Windows Vista
		- Windows 8
		- Windows 8.1
		- Windows 10
			- Home
			- Pro
			- Enterprise
			- LTSB
			- Education
			- Mobile
			- IoT
		- Windows 11
		
Windows Booting process:
------------------------
Ways to boot the WinOS
	1. Cold boot
		- whan a computer starts for the 1st time, after power on button is pressed.
	2. Hard/Warm boot
		- computer restarts while powered on during the hard boot.
		- this is useful while installing or uninstalling the software or updating the machine.
		
Booting process
---------------

1. BIOS/EFI
	- BIOS = Basic Input Output System
		- perform a test POST test
			Power On Self Test = checking of hardware devices
	- EFI = Extensible Firmware Interface
		- UEFI = Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
			- its a software between OS & platform firmware (hardware)

2. MBR
	- Master Boot Record
	- it contains the address of operating system
	- the size of MBR is "512 bytes"
	
3. Volume Boot Sector
	- its a boot sector (by IBM), that contains necessary code to start the boot process.
	
4. bootmgr.exe
	- it accesses the boot configuration data stored & uses the information to load the operating system and calls "winload.exe" or "winresume.exe"
		- winload.exe
			- this loads the necessary device drivers & the core part of the OS i.e, kernel (ntoskrnl.exe)
		- winresume.exe
			- its an OS file that resumes from hibernate boot mode.
			
5. ntoskrnl.exe
	- the kernel file getting called by bootmgr.exe
	
6. HAL.DLL
	- Hardware Abstraction Layer. Dynamic Link Library
	- it is a crucial component od windows OS as it acts as a bridge between hardware & software to communicate efficiently.
	
7. SMSS.exe
	- Session Manager Sub-System
	- its the 1st usermode process started by kernel.
	- once started, it creates additional paging files, env variables located at registry.
	- this manager is responsible for starting the kernel and user mode of Win32 system.
	- including win32k.sys, winsrv.dll & csrss.exe (user mode)
	- it is also responsible for doing any operations that are requested to be done at the start of the session. Like "autochk" & "convert".
	- this manager also started the registry keys.
	- after windows vista, SMSS creates a temporary instance of itself that launches the windows startup application (wininit.exe) and a second client/server runtime subsystem (csrss.exe) for dedicated session to start system process
	- from here, the windows startup application starts the service control manager (services.exe)
	
8. CSRSS.exe
	- Client/Server Runtime Sub-System
	- primarily, it will load the process & thread mgmt, console windows handling, side by side assembly & shutdown process.
	- this is a very CRUICIAL process, as killing one process can lead to crash of the OS giving the BSOD (Blue Screen of Death). 
		kill -> svchost
		
6 steps of booting process:
-----------------------------
	1. BIOS & setup program
	2. POST test
	3. the OS loads
	4. System configuration
	5. System utilities loads
	6. user authentication
	
	
Hypervisior tool:
- is the software that helps you in achieving the virtualization.
- hypervisors are of 2 types:
	1. Type 1 HV
		- bare matel HV
		- these are directly installed on top of the hardware, with no OS on it.
		- ex:	
			- Microsoft Hyper V
			- VMWare ESXi
			- Citrix Xenservers
	2. Type 2 HV
		- guest-based / OS-based HV
		- these requires an operating system to work
		- ex:
			- Microsoft Hyper-V
			- Oracle Virtual Box
			- Linux KVM
			- VMWare Workstation
			
			
Installing windows 10 OS:
-------------------------
- pre-requisites
	1. VMWare workstation 17
		Link: https://www.vmware.com/go/getworkstation-win
	2. Windows 10 ISO file 
		Link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10
	3. Enable either of them from BIOS setup.
		a. Intel-VT						//OR
		b. Virtualization technology
	4. Minimum requirements for installing Win10:
		a. Processors: 1GHz
		b. RAM: 1GB (32bit), 2GB (64bit)
		c. HDD: 16GB for 32bit, 20GB for 64bit 
		
		
Create only the configuration of the VM: upto the disk space (unlimited)
how many VMs can be started/executed at a time: limited (upto RAM)


Hypervisiors
------------------
Type 1 hypervisiors
	- used in production env
	- Ex:
		- Microsoft Hyper-V  -> download manually from MS site.
		- VMWare ESXi
		- Citrix Xen servers
		
Type 2 hypervisiors
	- used in home laptops/desktops, small/mid-level org.
	- Ex:
		- Microsoft Hyper-V
			- is a built-in package with your operating system.
				- Win 8, 8.1, 10, 11
			- free to use, if you enable it.
		- VMWare Workstation
			- Windows (VMWare Workstation) / MacOS (VMWare Fusion)
			- it requires license
			- its not free.
			- but "VMWare player" is free.
		- Linux KVM
			- KVM = kernel-based virtual machine
			- only for Linux based OS.
		- Oracle Virtual Box
			- freeware tool
			- no license required.
			
			
RDP
	- Remote Desktop Protocol
	- works on 3389
	- it connects 2 windows machines that are remotely available
	- requires
		1. Pulic IP address
		2. port 3389
		3. username
		4. password
	
Virtual Switches in Hyper-V Manager:
------------------------------------
3 types of switches
	1. Private network switch
		- allows the communication between virtual machines within hyper-v host.
	2. Internal network switch
		- allows the communication between VMs and Hyper-V host.
	3. External network switch
		- allows the communication between hyper-v manager & outside network.

#####################################################################################
- hyper-v manager installation.
- creation of private, internal & external switches.
- downloading of win10 ISO using media creation tool.
- downloading of centos 7 ISO. (URL: http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/)
- edge browser.

PowerShell -> to create users in bulk. --> windows server

creation of group
creation of users
adding the users to the group (remote desktop connection group)
login in to the RDP connection.

IP address:
--------------
by default, when an OS is installed.
	- the IP address allocated is dynamic IP.
to open IP console --> "ncpa.cpl"


in Windows Firewall, there are 3 types networks
	1. Private network
		- within the windows OS.
	2. Guest/Public network
		- from win10 to internet & vice versa.
	3. Domain network
		- within a domain.
