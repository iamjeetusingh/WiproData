Dynamic routing
------------------
types:
	- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
	- IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
	- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
	- OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
	- EGP (Exterior Gateway protocol)
	- BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
	- IS-IS (Immediate system-to-Immediate system)

Layerwise routing protocol:
	- Data link layer 
		- ARP - map IP address to MAC address
	- Network layer (layer 3)
		- RIP
		- OSPF
		- BGP
		- IS-IS
	- Transport layer (layer 4)
		- Load balancing
		- Traffic shapping
		- TCP
		- UDP

1. Distance Vector Routing Protocol
		- Distance = hop count
		- Vector   = direction
	- this protocol chooses shortest route with the least number of HOPS to reach from A to B.
	
RIP
	- Routing Information Protocol
	- has 2 versions
		V1
			- it does not VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)
			- it supports classful subnets
				Class A -> /8
				Class B -> /16
				Class C -> /24
			- the destination address: 255.255.255.255
		V2
			- allows the VLSM
			- the destination address: 224.0.0.9 (multi-cast address)
			
	- it supports a maximum of 15 hop counts
	- Uses port 520/UDP
	- its periodic time is 30Sec.

IGRP 
	- Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
	- its cisco's proprietry product 
	- it is also a distance vector routing protocol
	- it is used for measuring 
		- bandwidth
		- delays
		- load
		- MTU - 1500
		- reliability
	- it transmits the info after every 90 secs
	- max. allowed hops: 255
	- simple
	- slow for the giant/large networks

#######################################################################

EIGRP 
	- Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
	- open source after 2014
	- aka hybrid routing protocol
	- EIGRP = RIP (v2) + OSPF
	- EIGRP creates 3 tables:
		1. Neighbour table
		2. Topology Table
		3. Routing Table


ASN:
	- Autonomous System Number
	- ranges from: 1-65535
		- 1-64511 		=> Public ASN
		- 64512-65535	=> Private ASN

OSPF
	- Open shortest path first
	- it sends a hello packet to the neighbour.
		R1 -> hello -> R2
		R2 -> hello -> R1
	- if any router does not respond for "40 Secs", then the other router will be considered out of th network.
	- there are no limits for the number of routers in OSPF
		RIP 	= 16
		EIGRP	= 255
		OSPF	= Unlimited
	- used for giant/large networks
	- it has fast convergence
		convergence: 1 path goes down, how to will it take to connect to another path.
	- it uses the concept of "Area Zero" aka backbone.
	- in OSPF, LSA (linked-state advertizement) containing:
		- Subnet
		- Router
		- other network infor
	- all these 3 details are save within LSDB (link-state database)
	- there are 3 steps:
		1. Becoming neighbours
			- 2 routers running OSPF on same network, agrees to form a neighbour relationship.
		2. Exchanging database (LSDB) information
			- routers swap thier LSDB with each other.
		3. Choose the best router.
			- best route is added to the routing table based on LSDB information.
			
			
writing reverse mask for OSPF:
--------------------------------
class A			10.0.0.0
default mask	255.0.0.0
reverse mask	0.255.255.255
		
class B			172.16.0.0
default mask	255.255.0.0
reverse mask	0.0.255.255

class C			192.168.1.0
default mask	255.255.255.0
reverse mask	0.0.0.255


Cisco IOS:
-----------
- IOS = Internetwork Operating system.
- used on vast majority of cisco devices
- its a CLI = Command line Interface OS
- it is a "context-sensitive" OS
	context-sensitive => with different modes
		>	usermode 		-> all show/display commands
		#	privilge mode	-> root access
		(config) #			-> global config
- before IOS version 15, IOS uses "monolithic architecture"
- but after version 15.0, it started using "Microservice architecture".
- almost all cisco devices have cisco IOS, except:
	- firewall
	- intrusion prevention system (IPS)
- connecting to the cisco devices:
	1. cable (console cable)
	2. softwares (hyper-terminal, putty, teraterm, Secure RT [paid])
	3. remote connection (telnet, SSH)

- Cisco SmartNet:
	- subscription for production
	- cisco itself will give you a support.
	- its not for testing envs. 
	
- Router booting process:
	1.	Router is powered on.
	2.	It performs POST (power on self-test).
	a.	It checks all the hardware, CPU, memory, etc. 
	3.	Bootstrap program is loaded & executed (whenever IOS is found, load it)
	4.	Bootstrap reads configuration register values & loads the IOS.
	5.	If bootstrap fails, it will drop boot sequence & then move it to the ROMMON troubleshooting program. 
	6.	If the IOS is loaded, it will try to load the config file.
	7.	Once the configuration is loaded then CLI interface will be present in front of you.

Firewalls:
----------------
- a network security devices	
	1. monitor
	2. control inbound/outbond network traffic.
	
- types of firewall:
	1. packet filter firewall
	2. stateful inspection firewall (dynamic packet filtering)
	3. proxy firewall
	4. Application level firewall
	5. Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW)
	
Security methods
	- firewall
	- IDS
	- IPS
	- VPNs
	- Access Control
	- patching (upgrading)
	- backup & disaster recovery
	- penetration testing -> white, grey hat hackers
