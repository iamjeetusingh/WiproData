Switching
---------
- Switch 	= a device to connect 2 or more computers
- Switching = the transfer of data pkt through a network switch
- cheap till very expensive range
- types of switches
	- unmanaged switch
		- which does not provide any advance features like vlans.
		- these are similar to HUBs.
		- thus, not an industry standard.
	- managed switch
		- these are the industry standard.
		- they provide additional features.
		- Cisco, Juniper, HP
- it works at layer 2 (data link layer)
- it works on MAC addresses
- it maintains the MAC address table.

Cisco heirarchical design model
--------------------------------
1. Access layer switch
	- your computers are directly connected here.
	- these are the cheapest switches
	- Range: 1900-2900
2. Distribution layer switch
	- used by ISPs
	- these switches sits on the top of access layer switch
	- these are costly than the ALS
	- Range: 3000-5000
3. Core layer switch
	- these are responsible for managing huge networks
	- Very expensive/costly
	- Range: 7000, 8000, 10000, 12000..
	
Types of switches:
-------------------
Virtual switch 		- inside the VM env.
Routing  switch		- for connecting LANs.
Unmanaged switch	- small/home networks.
Managed switch		- industries/big networks.
LAN switch			- these avoid the overlapping of data packets
PoE switch			- Power over Ethernet, Gigabit ethernet
Smart switch		- partial managed switch, has additional control over data transmission


NOTE: all the managed switches will have by-default 1 VLAN (VLAN-1) present.


Layer 2 swtiches:
-------------------
- it works on Layer 2 (data link layer)
- it deals with MAC addresses
- it uses MAC to determine where to send the data.
- are traditional and common switches

Layer 3 swtiches (network):
-------------------
- aka multi-layer switches
- bcoz these work on layer 3 & layer 2.
- this layer deals with the IP address of the machine.
- since it is working on layer 3, it deals with the routing.
- to allow communication between 2 VLANs, we can use layer 3 switch.
- it uses inter-vlan routing to communicate.
- Layer 3 switch has SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) to connect to VLANs.
