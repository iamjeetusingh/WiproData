Hypervisior tool 
	- a tool to achieve virtualization
	- 2 types
		1. Type-1 HV
			- bare matel HV
			- installed on top on physical machine & do not require an OS.
			- ex:
				- Microsoft Hyper-V
				- VMWare ESXi
				- Citrix Xenservers
		2. Type-2 HV
			- guest-based / OS-based HV
			- installed on top of your current operating system.
			- ex:
				- Microsoft Hyper-V
			- Oracle Virtual Box
				- VMWare workstation
				- Linux KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)
				
IP addresses
	1. Private IP address
	2. Public IP address
		- Dynamic Public IP address
			- IP will change 
		- Static Public IP address
			- IP will NOT change 
			
Assign/Give the IP address:
--------------------------
1. DHCP (Dynamic Host Config Protocol)
2. Manually assigning
	ncpa.cpl --> select nic and add manually
3. APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)
	- range: 169.254.0.1 - 169.254.255.254 (169.254.X.X)
	
Classes in IP address (IPv4)
----------------------------
	11111111.1111111.00000000.11110000
			  192.168.0.10
			  
5 classes (0-255 = 256)
	Class A -> 0-127	-> used for huge networks of hosts
	Class B -> 128-191	-> used for medium size networks
	Class C -> 192-223	-> used for local area network (LAN)
	Class D -> 224-239	-> Reserved
	Class E -> 240-255	-> Reserved
	
0.0.0.0 		-> Any network
10.0.0.0		-> used for assigning Class A private IP address
127.0.0.1		-> Loop back IP address.
172.16.0.0		-> used for assigning Class B private IP address
192.168.0.0		-> used for assigning Class C private IP address



OSI Model
-----------
1. Physical Layer		=> Transmits raw data over the cable.
2. Data Link Layer		=> Manages communication between devices on the same network segment
3. Network Layer		=> Routes the data packets across diff networks.
4. Transport Layer		=> Provides reliable data delivery and manages end-to-end communication
5. Session Layer		=> Establishes, maintain & terminates session between application
6. Presentation Layer	=> Translates data into a format that application can understand.
7. Application Layer	=> Provides interface for user application to access n/w services.


TCP/IP Model
-------------
1. Application layer
2. Transport layer
3. Network layer
4. Data link layer
5. Physical layer

Switching
---------
- Switch 	= a device to connect 2 or more computers
- Switching = the transfer of data pkt through a network switch
- cheap till very expensive range
- types of switches
	- unmanaged switch
		- which does not provide any advance features like vlans.
		- these are similar to HUBs.
		- thus, not an industry standard.
	- managed switch
		- these are the industry standard.
		- they provide additional features.
		- Cisco, Juniper, HP
- it works at layer 2 (data link layer)
- it works on MAC addresses
- it maintains the MAC address table.

Cisco heirarchical design model
--------------------------------
1. Access layer switch
	- your computers are directly connected here.
	- these are the cheapest switches
	- Range: 1900-2900
2. Distribution layer switch
	- used by ISPs
	- these switches sits on the top of access layer switch
	- these are costly than the ALS
	- Range: 3000-5000
3. Core layer switch
	- these are responsible for managing huge networks
	- Very expensive/costly
	- Range: 7000, 8000, 10000, 12000..
	
Types of switches:
-------------------
Virtual switch 		- inside the VM env.
Routing  switch		- for connecting LANs.
Unmanaged switch	- small/home networks.
Managed switch		- industries/big networks.
LAN switch			- these avoid the overlapping of data packets
PoE switch			- Power over Ethernet, Gigabit ethernet
Smart switch		- partial managed switch, has additional control over data transmission


NOTE: all the managed switches will have by-default 1 VLAN (VLAN-1) present.


Layer 2 swtiches:
-------------------
- it works on Layer 2 (data link layer)
- it deals with MAC addresses
- it uses MAC to determine where to send the data.
- are traditional and common switches

Layer 3 swtiches (network):
-------------------
- aka multi-layer switches
- bcoz these work on layer 3 & layer 2.
- this layer deals with the IP address of the machine.
- since it is working on layer 3, it deals with the routing.
- to allow communication between 2 VLANs, we can use layer 3 switch.
- it uses inter-vlan routing to communicate.
- Layer 3 switch has SVI (Switch Virtual Interface) to connect to VLANs.
