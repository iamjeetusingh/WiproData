Routers
----------
- its a networking device to allow communication between 2 or more NETWORKS.
- a home router
	- is a combination of everything
		- router
		- modem
		- switch
- Types of routers:
	1. Branch router
		- used for small org. 
		- series: 800, 1800, 2800, 2900..
	2. Internet-edge router
		- used by mid-level orgs. 
		- series: 1000, 7000, 7500, 7560, 7600...
	3. Service provide router
		- used by WAN or big/huge orgs. like ISPs.
		- series: 900, 1000, 7200, 7300, 7600...
		
Routing:
--------
- is a process of selecting path/route along which the data can be transfered from source to destination. 
- routing is done with the help of router
- routing works on "network layer" of OSI model.
- routing works on "internet layer" of TCP/IP model.
- Routing Algo. are used for routing the packets
	- Routing Algo = is a software responsible for deciding the optimal path.
- Types of Routing:
	1. Static routing
	2. Default routing
	3. Dynamic routing
	
Static routing:
---------------
- aka non-adaptive routing
- admins manually adds routes in the routing table.

- advantages:
	- no over head
		- no cpu usage, thus CHEAP.
	- Bandwidth
		- no bandwidth usage between routers
	- security
		- its more secured, bcoz, admins only allow the particular traffic.
		
- disadvantages:
	- for larger network, its very difficult to add each route.
	- admins must have GOOD knowledge on topologies.
	
	
Default routing:
------------------
- its a technique in which a router is configured to send all the pkts to the same hop.
- 

Dynamic routing:
-----------------
- aka adaptive routing
- its a technique where router adds a new route in the routing table for each pkt. 
- dynamic routing basically uses protocols for adding the routes. 
- in case of a router failure, automcatically adjustments will be made to reach the destination.

advantages:
- its easier
- its more effective in selecting the best optimal path.

disadvantages:
- its more expensive, in terms of 	
	- CPU,
	- Bandwidth
- its less secure than default and static routing.

Terms:
-------
1. Aux port
	- auxilary port
	- used as a dial up for remote management.
2. Serial port
	- used for configuration, diagnostics or emergency maintainence
	- used for connection routers
3. Console port
	- a physical port that allows communication & control of the devices.
	- its a CLI for configuration, troubleshooting and monitoring.
4. FastEthernet port (fa)
	- upto 10Kms
	- 100 Mbps
	- in 1995
5. GigabitEthernet port
	- in 1999
	- 10 times faster than FastEthernet
	- 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
	
Routing:
###########
1. Static routing
	- no protocols are used here.
	- you need to add routes "manually".
	- it requires 2 things
		1. IP & subnet mask
		2. outgoing interface/next hop address.
2. Dynamic routing
	- it uses protocols to perform routing
	- Major protocols:
		1. IRP = Interior Routing Protocol
			a. RIP
			b. EIGRP
			c. OSPF
			d. IS-IS
		2. ERP = Exterior Routing Protocol
			a. EGP
			b. BGP
