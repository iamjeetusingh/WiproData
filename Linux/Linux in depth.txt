UNIX
- it was launched publicly on 1st jan 1970
- UNIX = UNICS = UNiplexed Information Computing System.

NOTE: the difference between 1st jan 1970 and today == EPOCH date.


Opensource
	- free to use
	- free to download
	- free to share
	- source code can be changed
	- Ex: Linux operating system
	
Freeware
	- free to use
	- free to download
	- free to share
	- no source code can be changed
	- Ex: UNIX operating system
	
Linux
- 17th sept 1991
- Linux is derived from UNIX.


Linux is meant to be ROOT,
Windows is meant to be REBOOT.


in win = administrator
in linux = root

top 500 supercomputer --> LINUX OS.


- by default, 7 users (same or different) can login at the same time. 
	- if you make changes in kernel, then this number can go upto 44.
	
GUI & CLI - UNIX
CLI & GUI - Linux  99.99999999% --> CLI in Linux

SELinux
	- security enhanced linux
	- by default, denies to every incoming request that tries to modify the kernel.
	- 3 modes of SELinux
		1. enforcing 	=> 100% active
		2. permission 	=> partial active
		3. disabled		=> 100% inactive
	
types of shell
	- C shell (csh)
	- Korn shell (ksh)
	- bourne shell (sh)
	- bourne again shell (bash)	--> default shell in all new OSs.
	- POSIX
	- tcsh
all installed shell names are present in "/etc/shells"


Runlevel
---------------
- its the mode, in which you want to start the server.
- 7 types of runlevel:
	init 0	= halt/shutdown								= poweroff.target
	init 1	= single user maintainence mode, no NFS		= multi-user.target
	init 2	= multi-user maintainence mode, no NFS		= multi-user.target
	init 3	= fully functional server in CLI mode		= multi-user.target
	init 4	= unused till date							= NA
	init 5	= init 3 + GUI								= graphical.target
	init 6	= reboot/restart							= reboot.target
	
Standard: Linux uses 14 sub-directories to store the data.

windows = folder		software
linux   = directory		package



Filesytem Hierarchy standard:
--------------------------------
/
	- /bin		= contains cmds executed by regular users.
	- /sbin		= contains cmds executed by only ROOT user.
	- /home 	= home directory for regular users
					- harika -> /home/harika
					- jeetu  -> /home/jeetu
					- ayush  -> /home/ayush
					- batman -> /home/batman
	- /root 	= home directory for ROOT user.
	- /etc		= contains all the configuration data in it.
	- /lib		= contains all the library header files in it. (for developers)
	- /libx64	= contains all the 64bit OS library header files in it. (for developers)
	- /var		= variable length files. log files are stored here.
	- /dev		= device related files are stored here.
	- /proc		= all running processes are stored here.
	- /usr		= all installed applications are stored here.
	- /tmp		= all temp files are stored.
	- /mnt		= mount point for all devices
					/mnt/myPD
	- /boot		= contains all the bootable files in it.
	
RAM: 4GB
HDD: 30GB
Core: 2


for remoting, we need:
--------------------------
1. IP address of the remote linux server 
	- public IP address: when connecting via internet.
	- private IP address: when connecting on
							- same host.
							- VPN
2. tool(s) for connecting to remote server
	- putty
	- MTputty
	- MobaXTerm
	- Windows PowerShell

3.  username & password			/OR
	username & SSH keys

command to change computer name:
#hostnamectl set-hostname <name>
	close & open terminal again.
	
screenshot --> photo, MBs
snapshot   --> capture a VM's state, GBs


Please note:
	- install the VM
	- disable the SELinux
	- take the SNAPSHOT of the virtual machine.
