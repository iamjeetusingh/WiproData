Storage topology:
---------------------
- its the arrangement or the config of storage devides within a network.
- common topologies to store the data:
	1. DAS (Direct-Attached storage) 
	2. NAS (Network-Attached Storage)
	3. SAN (Storage Area Network)

- Direct-Attached storage (DAS)
	- its connected directly to the computer or server.
	- it uses USB, SATA, SCSI
	- located near to the computer or server.
	- it is dedicated to one server/computer.
	- limited scalability
	- used for high-performance applicaiton, data retrieval.
	- low-cost solution for small-scale organizations.
	- Example:
		1. internal HDD.
		2. external HDD.
	
- Network-Attached Storage (NAS)
	- here, storage device is connected to multiple devices within the network.
	- it is not directly connected to any server, but accessible on multiple devices.
	- better scalability (than DAS)
	- performance is based on hardware & band-width.
	- for medium-level organizations
	- used for file sharing, backup, centralized storage, etc...
	
- Storage Area Network (SAN)
	- multiple devices are connected together to share the storage devices
	- it uses Fibre channel or iSCSI.
	- it is connected with array of disks. 
	- offers high-performance
	- manages the workload easily.
	- use for critical applications, reliability, scalability.
	- for enterprise-level organizations.
	- it contains 2 components:
		1. Server
		2. Network Infrastructure
		3. Storage
	- SAN components:
		- SAN Switches
		- SAN fabric
		- Physical disks
		- RAID group
		- connection:
			- HBA (Host Bus Adapter)
			- Controller.
RAID:
-------
- Redundant Array of Independent disks.		or
	[[- Redundant Array of Inexpensive disks.]]	
- its a low-cost solution for storing the data.
- RAID types:
	- RAID 0 (Stripping)
		- it stripes the data into multiple disks
		- faster write, slower read access.
		- if one drive/disk crashes, entire data is gone.
	- RAID 1 (Mirroring)
		- when data is stored in 1 disk, data is replicated immedietely to another disk.
		- fault tolerance.
		- 
	- RAID 2 
	- RAID 3
	- RAID 4
	- RAID 5 (striping with parity)
	- RAID 6 (Double parity)
	- RAID 10 (Mirroring + Stripping)
	
Storage Spaces:
-----------------
- in linux, we have LVM.
- in windows, we have storage spaces.	



Disk managements:
	- run -> diskmgmt.msc
	- win+x

Types:
	1. Basic disk
		- are static disks
		- these disks can not be expanded.
	2. Dynamic disks
		- these disks can be expanded.
			- stripping
			- mirroring
			- storage spaces

Backups:
-----------
- is the process of creating a copy of data for availability & easy to recover.
- it is useful in case of:
	- data loss
	- corruption
	- accidental deletion
	- data protection
	- disaster recovery
	- business continuity
- methods:
	1. Manual backups
	2. automated backups

Enterprise-level backups
	ex:
	- Commvault
	- Vertias Backup
	- Veeam backup

Small-Mid level:
	- Acronis backup
	- carbonite
	
Cloud backup:
	- AWS S3
	- Azure backup
	- Google CLoud Backup
	
Open source:
	- Bacula
	- Amanda
	- Duplicati
	
Backup architecture components:
-------------------------------
- source system
- backup client
- backup server
- storage devices
- backup media
- backup policies
- backup methods
	- full backup
	- incremental backup
	- differential backup
- monitoring tools
- disaster recovery plan
