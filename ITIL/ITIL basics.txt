ITIL V1:
	- in 1989
	- developed for providing best IT services.
	- ITIL framework contains 5 core process:
		1. Plan
		2. Manage
		3. Operate
		4. Optimize
		5. Review
		
ITIL V2:
	- in 2001,
	- this version was altered so that Microsoft Operation Framework foundation (MOF).
	- new integrated mgmt tool 
	- emphasis on flexible working assignments to help adapt to emerging market.
	
ITIL V3:
	- the main goal was to create comprehensive framework that covers all major areas of ITSM.
	- improved process mgmt, service delivery & change mgmt.
	
ITIL v4:
	- 2019
	- it contains major core processes:
		- service design
		- delivery
		- change
		- maintenance
		- analytics.
	- is considered to be the best version & it focuses on the practises like AGILE & DEVOPS.
	
Key concepts of ITIL:
--------------------------------
1. service lifecycle
	- it consists of various stages like:
		- service strategy
		- service design
		- service transition
		- service operation
		- continoual service improvement (CSI)
2. processes
	- defines the set of processes for IT including
		- incident mgmt
		- problem mgmt
		- change mgmt
		- service level mgmt
3. functions
	- ITIL describes functions within org that supports IT services like service desk, applicaiton mgmt.
4. roles & responsiblities
	- ITIL outlines various roles & responsiblities to ensure effective service delivery & support.
	
Core principle of ITSM:
------------------------
1. customer focus
	- it focuses on the needs of the customer
	- it helps in identifying customer requirements, defining service levels and continously improving the delivery to enhance customer satisfaction.
2. service orientation
	- it helps in designing, delivering & managing the services.
3. process orientation
	- helps in standardizing the activities, improving efficiency & ensuring consistency in service delivery.
4. continous improvement
	- it initiates the aim to optimise service quality, efficiency & business alignment with the needs.
	- it also regularly assess IT services, processes & performance.
	
various frameworks for ITSM:
-----------------------------
	- ITIL
	- TOGAF
	- Business process framework (eTOM)
	- COBIT (Control Objective for Information and Related Technologies)
	- FitSM
	- ASL
	- USM
	- BiSL
	- MOF (Microsoft Operation Framework)
	
Key Components of ITSM:
------------------------
1. Service strategy
	- this focuses on development strategies of IT services
	- this includes the market demands & defining services portfolois.
	
2. Service Design
	- it focuses on activities like service catalog mgmt, service level aggrement (SLA), capacity mgmt, availability mgmt.
	
3. Service Transition
	- it manages the transition of new service or changed service into the production environment with mimimum distruption or risk.
	- it includes change mgmt, release mgmt & deployment mgmt, knowledge mgmt.
	
4. Service Operation
	- it ensures the ongoing delivery & support of IT services to meet SLA.
	- it includes incident mgmt, problem mgmt, event mgmt, request fulfilment, access mgmt.
	
5. continoual service improvement (CSI)
	- CSI focuses on identifying the opportunities, efficiency & effectiveness of IT services.
	- it includes performance data, conducting service reviews, optimizing the service delivery processes.
	
Basic concept of ITIL4:
-------------------------
1. Service Value System (SVS)

7. continoual improvements
	- regular assessments & improvments of service mgmt.
	- it help organization to adapt changes according to the market needs.
	
RACI:- is widely used techique for clarifying & defining the roles & responsiblities within a project.
-------
	R = Responsible
	A = Accountable
	C = Consulted
	I = Informed

Responsible
	- this role refers to the person or group who is "responsible for performing" the task.
	- they are the one who are directly involved in executing the work.
	- we can have any number of responsible people in the team.
	
Accountable
	- this role refers to the person who ultimately owns the task.
	- this person is an individual person & ensures that the task is done correctly & on time.
	- every task/activity needs at least 1 accountable person.
	
Consulted
	- this role refers to individual person or group who provides inputs or expertise to the task.
	- but these people are not directly responsible for its execution.
	- they may offer advice, feedback or information to support the completion of the tasks.
	
Informed
	- this role refers to individual or groups who needs to be kept informed about the progress or outcome of the task.
	- they are not directly involved in the execution
	- but these people/group must be informed.
	
RACI alternatives:
---------------------------
DACI:
	D = driver		= responsible individual in-charge of making sure a decision is made.
	A = Approver	= People who make final decisions.
	C = Contributor	= Experts that drivers asks for help.
	I = Informed	= people informed of the final decision.
	
RASCI:
	R = Responsible	= who needs to make sure the project reaches completion.
	A = Accountable = who has ultimate control over the project.
	S = Support		= who will provide help to the responsible members.
	C = Consulted	= who will give advice to the responsible members.
	I = Informed	= who needs to be kept in the loop at every stage.
	
	
	
Service Level Management (SLM) - Pizza Delivery:
-------------------------------------------------
1. Defining the service level agreement (SLA)
	delivery time	: 30mins
	pizza quality	: host, fresh
	customer service: polite, helpful
	
2. Monitoring service performance
	delivery time		: track the time for preparing, cooking & delivering the food.

3. Responding to service issues
	late delivery		: discounts & coupons
	quality issues		: replacement or refund.
	customer complaints	: address & resolve the problems.
	
4. Continoual improvements
	process optimization	: bootleneck situation.

	- change mgmt involves establishing a formal process for
		requesting
		evaluating
		approving
		implementing & 
		reviewing changes

2. Change Type:
	- standard change
		- pre-authorized & routine change
	- normal change
		- moderate risj & complexity
	- emergency change
		- urgent & high-priority changes
		
3. Change Advisory Board (CAB)
	- key component of change mgmt
	- its responsibility is to assessing & evaluating proposed changes, making recommendations for approval/rejection.
	
4. Change Models and Templates
	- it helps in ensuring consistency and efficiency in handling changes.
	
5. Risk assessment & Impact Analysis
	- it helps in identifying potential issues and plan appropiate mitigation strategies
	
6. Change authorization & approval
	- changes are authorization & approved based on criteria like risk level, business impact, compliance requirements
	- authorization & approval are obtained from CAB, stackholders, senior mgmt.
	
7. Change implementation & review:
	- approved changes are implemented according to pre-defined procedures
	
8. Post-implementation Review (PIR)
	- after the changes are implemented.
	- this helps in enhancing the process & optimizing future changes.
	
Change Management Flow/Process:
--------------------------------
1. Request for change (RFC)
	- the begining of the change mgmt process
	- its a formal request to implement the changes.
	- it can be originated by
		- users
		- customer
		- IT staff
		- automated monitoring system

2. Initial assessment
	- then change mgmt tean will conduct initial assessment to gather information abt the proposed changes.
		
3. Change evaluation:
	- this assessment includes evaluating the nature of changes, its impact, urgency, risk level & dependencies.
	
4. Change Approval:
	- CAB or stackholders reviews & then make decision for approval/rejection
	
5. Change planning:
	- once changes are approved, the change mgmt team plans for activities, resources, and timeline.
	
6. Change Implementation:
	- only the approved changes are to be implemented here. 
	- this includes coordinating with stackholders, conducting tests and following approved procedures.
	
7. Change Review and closure:
	- after the changes are implemented, change mgmt team conducts the post-implementation review (PIR) to assess the effectiveness of the changes, identifying lession learned and then documenting it.
	- once everything is successfull, then change id closed. 
	
8. change communication & documentation:
	- informing the stackholders & others that the problem is resolved.
	
Service Management :
---------------------
