ITIL V1:
	- in 1989
	- developed for providing best IT services.
	- ITIL framework contains 5 core process:
		1. Plan
		2. Manage
		3. Operate
		4. Optimize
		5. Review
		
ITIL V2:
	- in 2001,
	- this version was altered so that Microsoft Operation Framework foundation (MOF).
	- new integrated mgmt tool 
	- emphasis on flexible working assignments to help adapt to emerging market.
	
ITIL V3:
	- the main goal was to create comprehensive framework that covers all major areas of ITSM.
	- improved process mgmt, service delivery & change mgmt.
	
ITIL v4:
	- 2019
	- it contains major core processes:
		- service design
		- delivery
		- change
		- maintenance
		- analytics.
	- is considered to be the best version & it focuses on the practises like AGILE & DEVOPS.
	
Key concepts of ITIL:
--------------------------------
1. service lifecycle
	- it consists of various stages like:
		- service strategy
		- service design
		- service transition
		- service operation
		- continoual service improvement (CSI)
2. processes
	- defines the set of processes for IT including
		- incident mgmt
		- problem mgmt
		- change mgmt
		- service level mgmt
3. functions
	- ITIL describes functions within org that supports IT services like service desk, applicaiton mgmt.
4. roles & responsiblities
	- ITIL outlines various roles & responsiblities to ensure effective service delivery & support.
	
Core principle of ITSM:
------------------------
1. customer focus
	- it focuses on the needs of the customer
	- it helps in identifying customer requirements, defining service levels and continously improving the delivery to enhance customer satisfaction.
2. service orientation
	- it helps in designing, delivering & managing the services.
3. process orientation
	- helps in standardizing the activities, improving efficiency & ensuring consistency in service delivery.
4. continous improvement
	- it initiates the aim to optimise service quality, efficiency & business alignment with the needs.
	- it also regularly assess IT services, processes & performance.
	
various frameworks for ITSM:
-----------------------------
	- ITIL
	- TOGAF
	- Business process framework (eTOM)
	- COBIT (Control Objective for Information and Related Technologies)
	- FitSM
	- ASL
	- USM
	- BiSL
	- MOF (Microsoft Operation Framework)
	
Key Components of ITSM:
------------------------
1. Service strategy
	- this focuses on development strategies of IT services
	- this includes the market demands & defining services portfolois.
	
2. Service Design
	- it focuses on activities like service catalog mgmt, service level aggrement (SLA), capacity mgmt, availability mgmt.
	
3. Service Transition
	- it manages the transition of new service or changed service into the production environment with mimimum distruption or risk.
	- it includes change mgmt, release mgmt & deployment mgmt, knowledge mgmt.
	
4. Service Operation
	- it ensures the ongoing delivery & support of IT servicesto meet SLA.
	- it includes incident mgmt, problem mgmt, event mgmt, request fulfilment, access mgmt.
	
5. continoual service improvement (CSI)
	- CSI focuses on identifying the opportunities, efficiency & effectiveness of IT services.
	- it includes performance data, conducting service reviews, optimizing the service delivery processes.
	
Basic concept of ITIL4:
-------------------------
1. Service Value System (SVS)
	- its the core or ITILv4
	- it represents the overall model for creating value throughout the IT services.
	- it includes
		- SVC
		- Guiding principle
		- continoual improvements
		- best practises
2. Service Value Chain (SVC)
	- its a flexible operating model for creation, delivery & supporting the IT services.
	- it contains keys:
		- Plan
		- Improve
		- Engage
		- Design
		- Transition
		- deliver & support
3. Guiding principle
	- 7 guiding principles are used for guiding operations in making-decision & service mgmt.
		1. focusing on values
		2. where you are 
		3. progressing iteratively with feedback
		4. collaborating & promoting visibility
		5. thinking & working holistically
		6. keeping it simple & practical
		7. optimizing & automating.
4. 4th dimension of service mgmt:
	- organization & people
	- information & technolog
	- partners & suppliers &
	- value streams and processes.
5. Service Value System (SVS) components:
	- service value chain
	- practices
	- guiding principles
	- governance
	- continoual improvements
6. ITIL practices	
	- service desk
	- incident mgmt
	- change control
	- service level mgmt
7. continoual improvements
	- regular assessments & improvments of service mgmt.
	- it help organization to adapt changes according to the market needs.
	
RACI:- is widely used techique for clarifying & defining the roles & responsiblities within a project.
-------
	R = Responsible
	A = Accountable
	C = Consulted
	I = Informed

Responsible
	- this role refers to the person or group who is "responsible for performing" the task.
	- they are the one who are directly involved in executing the work.
	- we can have any number of responsible people in the team.
	
Accountable
	- this role refers to the person who ultimately owns the task.
	- this person is an individual person & ensures that the task is done correctly & on time.
	- every task/activity needs at least 1 accountable person.
	
Consulted
	- this role refers to individual person or group who provides inputs or expertise to the task.
	- but these people are not directly responsible for its execution.
	- they may offer advice, feedback or information to support the completion of the tasks.
	
Informed
	- this role refers to individual or groups who needs to be kept informed about the progress or outcome of the task.
	- they are not directly involved in the execution
	- but these people/group must be informed.
	
RACI alternatives:
---------------------------
DACI:
	D = driver		= responsible individual in-charge of making sure a decision is made.
	A = Approver	= People who make final decisions.
	C = Contributor	= Experts that drivers asks for help.
	I = Informed	= people informed of the final decision.
	
RASCI:
	R = Responsible	= who needs to make sure the project reaches completion.
	A = Accountable = who has ultimate control over the project.
	S = Support		= who will provide help to the responsible members.
	C = Consulted	= who will give advice to the responsible members.
	I = Informed	= who needs to be kept in the loop at every stage.
