Windows Server 2016:
--------------------
- job of a server is to "SERVE" to the client.
- serving:
	- IP address (DHCP)
	- name resolution (IP to name & name to IP --> DNS)

	1. Essentials
		- for small companies
		- either 1 physical machine or 1 virtual machine

Terms:
--------
Domain
	- a logical boundary of any organization.
	- it contains: OUs, policies, trust-relationships

Organizational Unit (OU)
	- its just like a department
	- it holds users, computers & groups.
	- users, computers & groups are indivi. called as objects.
	
Forest
	- collection of domains with active directory.

Domain Controller (DC)
	- is a server that responds to the authentication of users, enforcing the policies.
	
Sites	
	- a physical geographical location (BLR, Delhi, Chennai..)
	
Active Directory
	- is a directory service (by Microsoft) that acts as a directory (database) that stores information in it.
	- LDAP - Light-weight Directory Access Protocol
	
Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)
	- ADDS is a service that provides authentication & authorization services with the domain.
	- its a ROLE.
	
Role
	- a role is the functionality that a server must perform.
	- 25 roles
		- ex: DHCP, DNS, ADDS, ADFS, ADRMS, ADLDS.. 
	
Features
	- are the supporting functionalities of the role.
	- 60 features
	
Components of ADDS:
--------------------
	1. Physical component
		- domain controller
			- contains the copies of the ADDS database (NTDS.DIT). 
		- data store
			- the file on domain controller that stores the ADDS information.
		- global catalog server
			- the GC server increases the search speed of the objects within the domain.
		- RODC
			- Read only Domain controller
			- basically this DC is for branch offices where less technical people can "read only" the AD's information
	
	2. Logical component
		- Partition
			- a section of ADDS database. 
		- Schema
			- the blueprint of the database.
		- Domain
		- Domain tree
		- Forest
		- Site
		- Organizational Unit (OU)
		
		
Step to convert a regular server into a domain controller.

Post installation configuration
###############################
- configure the server name 
	- change the name
	- restart
- configure the IP address (static) 
	- it is recommended to have a static IP address for domain controller.
		IP: 		192.168.10.10
		subnet:		255.255.255.0
		gateway:	192.168.10.1
- configure the local settings
	- firewall
	- IE..
	- date & time

##############################
##############################
   take snapshot of the DC
##############################
##############################


to get ADDS on your server:
##############################
- install the ADDS role using 
	1. server manager dashboard page (use this)
	2. powershell
1. installed a server
2. installed ADDS role
3. promote this ADDS installed server to DC


Note: when you promote a server to domain controller, DNS role automatically get installed. 

domain name (forest name): jeetusingh.in
login as domain admin	 : domainname\username
login as domain admin	 : jeetusingh\administrator

Ques: How will you identity that the server you are working on is an ADDS server?
Ans:  1. ADDS & DNS enteries on the dashboard page.
	  2. active directory related enteries under "TOOLS" tab.
	  
ADDS administration tools:
---------------------------
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
	a. Active Directory Administration Snap-ins
	b. Active Directory Administration center
Command Line Interface (CLI)
	a. Active Directory Modules for Windows PowerSHell
	b. Directory Service Commands
	
	
	
- Open Active Directory Users & Computers
- create an OU
- create few users and add them to the OU.


Windows Servers:
----------------
	1. Windows server GUI
	2. Server Core OS (CLI) --> sconfig.cmd
	3. Nano server (CLI--> PowerSHell)
	
Task:
-------
	- turn off client01, not the DC.
	- install windows 10
		- IP			: 192.168.10.12
		- subnet		: 255.255.255.0
		- default GW	: 192.168.10.10
		- DNS			: 192.168.10.10
	- ping to the DC.
	- domain join the windows 10 to your domain controller machine.
		
		
Windows Native tools:
-----------------------
	1. Active Directory Administrative Center
		- works for the admin related tasks
			- creating a user
			- modifying a user
			- creating a group
			- editing a group/OU (disabling accendental deletion)
	2. Active Directory Domain & Trusts
		- help in trusting the domains
	3. Active Directory Sites & services	
		- for creating & managing sites
	4. Active Directory users & computers
		- create, modify, delete users
		- create, modify, delete computers
	5. Active Directory modules for powershell
		- here, we run all active directory related powershell cmdlets.
		- create, modify, delete --> users, computers, groups, OUs.....
	
PowerSHell ISE
	- ISE = Integrated Scripting Environment
	- it is used for writing the scripts.
	- it has INTELLI-SENSE
	
DNS:
-------
- domain name system
- DNS resolves name to IP & vice-versa.
- DNS is a role.
- DNS creates several records
	- A record 		- stores the IPv4 address
	- AAAA record 	- stores the IPv6 address
	- PTR record 	- POINTER record points back to the origin
	- CNAME record 	- canonical name (alias/alternative name)
	- MX record		- Mail Exchange, used where email servers are configured
	- SOA record	- Start of authority
	- txt record	- text data record.
	- NS record		- nameserver (FQDN - Fully Qualified Domain Name)
					- web01.blr.wipro.com

troubleshooting commands & tools:
----------------------------------
- nslookup (dig)
	- windows & linux based command
	- for getting the DNS server details
- DNSCmd 
	- a CLI tool
	- to manage the DNS server role
- Dnslint
	- for common diagnostics issues.
	- generates HTML reports.
- ipconfig
	- ipconfig /displaydns
	- ipconfig /flushdns
	- ipconfig /registerdns
